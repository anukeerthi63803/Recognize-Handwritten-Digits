# Recognize-Handwritten-Digits

![Handwritten Digit Recognition]

This repository contains a project that focuses on recognizing handwritten digits using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to build and train a model that can accurately classify hand-drawn digits into the numbers 0-9. The model is trained on a popular dataset like MNIST and implemented using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

## Introduction

Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision. This project aims to demonstrate how to train a deep learning model to accurately classify images of handwritten digits. The model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics are discussed in detail.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
    git clone https://github.com/anukeerthi63803/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd handwritten-digit-recognition
3. Install the required dependencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Prepare your own handwritten digit images or use the provided test images in the `test_images` directory.

2. Modify the `predict.py` script to load your trained model and predict the digit for your images.

3. Run the prediction script:
    python predict.py

## Model

The model architecture used for this project is a deep neural network with multiple hidden layers. The architecture details, hyperparameters, and training strategies can be found in the `model.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), which consists of a large collection of handwritten digits. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each representing a single digit from 0 to 9.

## Results

The trained model achieves an accuracy of over 95% on the test dataset. The model's performance can be further improved by experimenting with different architectures, regularization techniques, and optimization algorithms.
